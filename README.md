# Guess the Metal Band
How well can you read completely random metal band logos?
Some are painfully easy while others look like something the cat threw up.

## What is this?
A dumb game I made in BackboneJS with apologies to damn.dog and MetalSucks.net's Completely Unreadable Band Logo of the Week.
You get a random metal band logo from Metal Archives.net and have to try to decipher it. Some are straightforward and others are nigh impenetrable.

## Can I play?
You can by downloading the source, but I still need to decide on where to host it, at which point I'll wire it into the live API. URL names welcome!
